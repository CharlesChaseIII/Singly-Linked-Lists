# Singly-Linked-Lists
1) Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. Assume the lists are non-cyclical.  For example, given A = 3 ➔ 7 ➔ 8 ➔ 10 and B = 99 ➔ 1 ➔ 8 ➔ 10, return the node with value 8. In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.  Do this in 0( m + n) time (where m and n are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
